Pull requests, or feature requests, though not always implemented, are a great way to help make Knex even better than it is now. If you&#39;re looking for something specific to help out with, there&#39;s a number of unit tests that aren&#39;t implemented yet, the library could never have too many of those. If you want to submit a fix or feature, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/knex/knex/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contributing</a> readme in the Github and go ahead and open a ticket.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-debug" tabindex="-1">How do I debug? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-debug" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Knex is beginning to make use of the <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/debug" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debug</a> module internally, so you can set the <code>DEBUG</code> environment variable to <code>knex:*</code> to see all debugging, or select individual namespaces <code>DEBUG=knex:query,knex:tx</code> to constrain a bit.</p><p>If you pass <code>{debug: true}</code> as one of the options in your initialize settings, you can see all of the query calls being made. Sometimes you need to dive a bit further into the various calls and see what all is going on behind the scenes. I&#39;d recommend <a href="https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">node-inspector</a>, which allows you to debug code with <code>debugger</code> statements like you would in the browser.</p><p>At the start of your application code will catch any errors not otherwise caught in the normal promise chain handlers, which is very helpful in debugging.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-run-the-test-suite" tabindex="-1">How do I run the test suite? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-run-the-test-suite" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The test suite looks for an environment variable called <code>KNEX_TEST</code> for the path to the database configuration. If you run the following command:</p><div class="language-bash"><pre><code>$ <span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">KNEX_TEST</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">&#39;/path/to/your/knex_config.js&#39;</span>
$ <span class="token function">npm</span> <span class="token builtin class-name">test</span>
</code></pre></div><p>replacing with the path to your config file, and the config file is valid, the test suite should run properly.</p><h2 id="my-tests-are-failing-because-slow-db-connection-and-short-test-timeouts-how-to-extend-test-timeouts" tabindex="-1">My tests are failing because slow DB connection and short test timeouts! How to extend test timeouts? <a class="header-anchor" href="#my-tests-are-failing-because-slow-db-connection-and-short-test-timeouts-how-to-extend-test-timeouts" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Sometimes, e.g. when running CI on travis, test suite&#39;s default timeout of 5 seconds might be too short. In such cases an alternative test timeout value in milliseconds can be specified using the <code>KNEX_TEST_TIMEOUT</code> environment variable.</p><div class="language-bash"><pre><code>$ <span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">KNEX_TEST_TIMEOUT</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">30000</span>
