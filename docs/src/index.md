<div class="container-home">

**Knex.js** (pronounced [/kəˈnɛks/](https://youtu.be/19Av0Lxml-I?t=521)) is a "batteries included" SQL query builder for **PostgreSQL**, **CockroachDB**, **MSSQL**, **MySQL**, **MariaDB**, **SQLite3**, **Better-SQLite3**, **Oracle**, and **Amazon Redshift** designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use.

It features both traditional node style [callbacks](/guide/interfaces#callbacks) as well as a [promise](/guide/interfaces#promises) interface for cleaner async flow control, [a stream interface](/guide/interfaces#streams), full-featured [query](/guide/query-builder) and [schema](/guide/schema-builder) builders, [**transaction support (with savepoints)**](/guide/transactions), connection [pooling](/guide/#pool) and standardized responses between different query clients and dialects.
