# Raw


Sometimes you may need to use a raw expression in a query. Raw query object may be injected pretty much anywhere you want, and using proper bindings can ensure your values are escaped properly, preventing SQL-injection attacks.

## Raw Parameter Binding

One can paramterize sql given to `knex.raw(sql, bindings)`. Parameters can be positional named. One can also choose if parameter should be treated as value or as sql identifier e.g. in case of `'TableName.ColumnName'` reference.

```js
knex('users')
  .select(knex.raw('count(*) as user_count, status'))
  .where(knex.raw(1))
  .orWhere(knex.raw('status <> ?', [1]))
  .groupBy('status')
```

Positional bindings `?` are interpreted as values and `??` are interpreted as identifiers.

```js
knex('users').where(knex.raw('?? = ?', ['user.name', 1]))
```

Named bindings such as `:name` are interpreted as values and `:name:` interpreted as identifiers. Named bindings are processed so long as the value is anything other than `undefined`.

```js
const raw = ':name: = :thisGuy or :name: = :otherGuy or :name: = :undefinedBinding'

knex('users')
  .where(
    knex.raw(raw, {
      name: 'users.name',
      thisGuy: 'Bob',
      otherGuy: 'Jay',
      undefinedBinding: undefined
  }))
```

For simpler queries where one only has a single binding, `.raw` can accept said binding as its second parameter.

```js
knex('users')
  .where(
    knex.raw('LOWER("login") = ?', 'knex')
  )
  .orWhere(
    knex.raw('accesslevel = ?', 1)
  )
  .orWhere(
    knex.raw('updtime = ?', '01-01-2016')
  )
```

Since there is no unified syntax for array bindings, instead you need to treat them as multiple values by adding `?` directly in your query.

```js
const myArray = [1,2,3]
knex.raw('select * from users where id in (' + myArray.map(_ => '?').join(',') + ')', [...myArray]);

```
query will become:

```sql
select * from users where id in (?, ?, ?) /* with bindings [1,2,3] */
```

To prevent replacement of `?` one can use the escape sequence `\\?`.

```js
knex.select('*')
  .from('users')
  .where('id', '=', 1)
  .whereRaw('?? \\? ?', ['jsonColumn', 'jsonKey'])
```

To prevent replacement of named bindings one can use the escape sequence `\\:`.

```js
knex.select('*')
  .from('users')
  .whereRaw(":property: = '\\:value' OR \\:property: = :value", {
    property: 'name',
    value: 'Bob'
  })
```

## Raw Expressions

Raw expressions are created by using `knex.raw(sql, [bindings])` and passing this as a value for any value in the query chain.

```js
knex('users').select(knex.raw('count(*) as user_count, status'))
  .where(knex.raw(1))
  .orWhere(knex.raw('status <> ?', [1]))
  .groupBy('status')
```

## Raw Queries

The `knex.raw` may also be used to build a full query and execute it, as a standard query builder query would be executed. The benefit of this is that it uses the connection pool and provides a standard interface for the different client libraries.

```js
knex.raw('select * from users where id = ?', [1])
  .then(function(resp) { /*...*/ });
```

Note that the response will be whatever the underlying sql library would typically return on a normal query, so you may need to look at the documentation for the base library the queries are executing against to determine how to handle the response.

## Wrapped Queries

The raw query builder also comes with a `wrap` method, which allows wrapping the query in a value:

```js
const subcolumn = knex.raw(
    'select avg(salary) from employee where dept_no = e.dept_no'
  )
  .wrap('(', ') avg_sal_dept');

knex.select('e.lastname', 'e.salary', subcolumn)
  .from('employee as e')
  .whereRaw('dept_no = e.dept_no')
```

Note that the example above be achieved more easily using the [as](#Builder-as) method.

```js
const subcolumn = knex.avg('salary')
  .from('employee')
  .whereRaw('dept_no = e.dept_no')
  .as('avg_sal_dept');

knex.select('e.lastname', 'e.salary', subcolumn)
  .from('employee as e')
  .whereRaw('dept_no = e.dept_no')
```
