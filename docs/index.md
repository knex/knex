<div class="container-home">

**Knex.js** (pronounced [/kəˈnɛks/](https://youtu.be/19Av0Lxml-I?t=521)) is a "batteries included" SQL query builder for **PostgreSQL**, **CockroachDB**, **MSSQL**, **MySQL**, **MariaDB**, **SQLite3**, **Better-SQLite3**, **Oracle**, and **Amazon Redshift** designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use. 

It features both traditional node style [callbacks](#Interfaces-Callbacks) as well as a [promise](#Interfaces-Promises) interface for cleaner async flow control, [a stream interface](#Interfaces-Streams), full-featured [query](#Builder) and [schema](#Schema) builders, [**transaction support (with savepoints)**](#Transactions), connection [pooling](#Installation-pooling) and standardized responses between different query clients and dialects.
